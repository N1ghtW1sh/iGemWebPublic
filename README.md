# Actor Web Application

## Usage

First of all run `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

While you developing your application, run `npm start`.
This command runs webpack dev-server.

If you want to deploy your application, run `npm run build`.
This command compiles all your assets to `dist/` folder.

gulp build / npm run build

编译前删除dist文件夹防止文件重复
